# Parkinson's Disease Prediction
# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting Parkinson's disease using a dataset obtained from the Kaggle data bank. The dataset consists of 24 columns, and the goal is to develop the best machine learning model to classify individuals as either healthy (status 0) or having Parkinson's disease (status 1).

# Dataset
The dataset contains various features, but the target variable we are interested in is "status," which has binary values of 0 and 1. A status of 0 indicates a healthy individual, while a status of 1 indicates a person with Parkinson's disease.

# Problem Statement
This is a classification problem where the objective is to predict whether an individual has Parkinson's disease based on the provided features. The goal is to build an accurate model that can help in the timely diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Methodology
To address this problem, we will follow these steps:<br>

**Data Preprocessing**: We will clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering if necessary.<br>
**Model Selection**: We will experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as MLP, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, XGBoost etc.<br>
**Model Evaluation**: We will evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, and F1-score.<br>

# Repository Contents
**README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including the dataset, problem statement, methodology, and repository contents.<br>
**Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and selection.<br>
**Dataset**: Includes the dataset obtained from Kaggle data bank.<br>
# Usage
• Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
• Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to execute the code cells.<br>
• Explore different models, evaluate their performance, and select the best model for predicting Parkinson's disease.<br>
# Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable model that can accurately predict Parkinson's disease based on relevant features. Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing the condition effectively, and our model can potentially aid healthcare professionals in this process.
